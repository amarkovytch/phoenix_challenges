# Solutions to selected exercises from : https://exploit.education/phoenix/

The art of exploitation depends like no other on arsenal of various tips & tricks, architecture specific wizardry and all kinds of low level mechanics. Sometimes it can take you ten minutes to come up with a general idea for the exploit which will 'almost' work, but it can take you days or even weeks to make it work reliably. And by the way, it is those last 5-10% which will educate you the most. 

I documented solutions for exercises that took me some time to solve completely, I tried to explain not just the final solution, but rather things that I tried along the way and explain why those didn't work. Also, I tried to include useful technical tips that can save you a lot of time in endless googling (sometimes it is really hard to find an answer, since you can't even formulate the question properly)
